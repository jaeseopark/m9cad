# m9cad

m9cad is an app that lets you trace lines and curves over a frame of a video, as if you are drawing something in a video editing software. The drawing can be exported as SVG/PNG.

The app was originally developed because my wife repeatedly needed to trace the outline of objects for her video production work. Her computer at the time was far too slow to run [Motion](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/motion/); importing SVG files into the project was much faster than drawing things directly in Motion. She has since upgraded the computer so there isn't any use for the app anymore, but I am making the app publicly available in case someone finds it useful.

## Usage

1. Go to [fatfinger.click](https://fatfinger.click) and launch the app.
1. Drag-and-drop a local video file into the app. Most videos should work out of the box. To be sure, refer to your browser's documentation. [Here](https://www.chromium.org/audio-video) is a good starting point.
1. Jump to the frame of the video you want to draw over. Pause the video and start drawing.
1. Hit the _Save_ button at the top right corner when you are done.
